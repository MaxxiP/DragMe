# DragMe



DragMe is a little js based game in which you have to drag the Bubbles to your side to increase your points and decrease the enemys. Right now it's still early in development and no real multiplayer is implemented.

## Version 0.1a

```sh
  - Local playing possible (no end)
  - View Score on top
```

### Future Plans

```sh
  - implementing multiplayer
  - node.js Server
  - Bootstrap for graphical improvements
  - better css animation
  - a real end to the game
```
